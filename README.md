# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Project
 For this project the company Pewlett Hackard wants us to determine who is retiring within the next couple
of years and how many positions the company has to fill. In order to make sure that the company knows in 
advance which of their employees will retire, we will create a table of employees who will qualify for retirement
packages and their titles in the company from provided csv files.

## Results
After creating the tables by joining the employees and titles tables, and from there filter them by date of 
birth and date hired, making sure there are no duplicates, and ordering the data points by date hired there 
are 90,398 employees retiring.

In the image below you can see the breakdown of the employees retiring by job title.

## Conclusion
Within the next few years the Pewlett Hackard company has 64% of its employees either going into retirement or going into
the company's mentorship program. Knowing this the company has to take advantage of this data by begining its hiring 
process and take advantage of the mentorship program for all its new hire while they have employees who have extensive
experince in this field.
